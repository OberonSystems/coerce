* coerce

  For coercing values from one type to another with a consistent API

   clojure -M:test:runner-clj
   clojure -M:test:runner-cljs

   (= (coerce "2020-10-10" :date) #inst "2020-10-10")

   (= (coerce "10/10/2020"       :date   :pattern :dd|mm|yyyy) #inst "2020-10-10")
   (= (coerce #inst "2020-10-10" :string :pattern :dd|mm|yyyy) "10/10/2020")
